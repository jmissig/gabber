Gabber: We Need a New Tagline
------

Thanks for trying Gabber 2.

Gabber 2 requires:

libsigc++ 1.2 ( http://libsigc.sf.net/ )
	Please note that Gabber has NOT been tested with libsigc++ 2.0. 
Changes will probably need to be made to Jabberoo to get it to work.

gtkmm 2.0 ( http://www.gtkmm.org/ )
	Again, gtkmm 2.4 requires libsigc++ 2.0, which is UNTESTED.

gconfmm	2.0 ( http://www.gtkmm.org/ )
libglademm 2.0 ( http://www.gtkmm.org/ )

jabberoo 1.9.4 ( http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/ )
	The JabberOO version needs to match the Gabber version. It is 
necessary for compilation, but if you use --enable-static-jabberoo it is 
not necessary to include a separate binary of JabberOO.

Gabber 2's web site is http://gabber.jabberstudio.org/

Bugs may be filed at http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/gabber/bugs/

Compilation is a standard ./configure && make && sudo make install
On binary-based systems, you may need to set a --prefix=/usr or something 
similar.

Gabber 2 *CANNOT* be installed simultaneously with Gabber 1. The second 
you type 'make install' you are overwriting your Gabber 1 binary. If you 
wish to 'make install' Gabber 2, then be kind to your system and uninstall 
Gabber 1 first (otherwise you'll have a lot of useless files lying 
around). Should you choose not to 'make install' Gabber 2 (as would be 
the wise thing to do, as it is far from a 2.0 still), Gabber 2 will run 
just fine as ./src/gabber from within the source directory.

Just be sure you 'make install-schemas' so that 
Gabber's GConf data is properly installed.

If you want Raw XML Input, add the 'raw' module to the pluginlist in gconf.
Editing extra gconf keys is easily achieved using gconf-editor.
